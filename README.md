# ansible-common

A meta role to perform basic configuration.

## Ansible requirements

### Ansible version

Minimum required ansible version is 2.2.

### Ansible role dependencies

  * packages
  * openssh-server
  * accounts
  * ntpd

## Installation

### Install with Ansible Galaxy

```shell
ansible-galaxy install archf.common
```

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: archf.common
```

### Install with git

If you do not want a global installation, clone it into your `roles_path`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:archf/ansible-common.git /path/to/roles_path
```

But I often add it as a submdule in a given `playbook_dir` repository.

```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:archf/ansible-common.git <playbook_dir>/roles/common
```

As the role is not managed by Ansible Galaxy, you do not have to specify the
github user account.

Basic usage is:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
  - role: common
```
## User guide

This is a meta role to perform basic configuration. It contains no tasks and
its sole purpose is to tie together the roles listed as dependencies below.
